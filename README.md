[uboot-meetup](https://github.com/gnurenga/talks/tree/master/uboot-meetup)

This talk is based on my understanding about bootrom which
is helpful in downloading compiled firmware in to a Micro-controller.
How I related bootrom  while learning U-bootloader.
Explained about my zigbee firmware update project.
