== Testing

=== Overview

* Why we do testing ?
* What is product requirement ?

=== Need for Automation

* Testing becomes boring if it is monotonous
* Long hour testing is possible with Automation
* Automation testing with good report will
help to deliver a good product

== Today's session

=== We are going to see
    
* Requirement 
* About Remote Power Supply
* Testing the remote power supply manually
* Testing the remote power supply using Robot framework

=== Requirements

* Remote power supply should be able turn on/off remotely
* Remote power supply status should also be available remotely

=== About RPS
* RPS is a remotely controlled power supply unit 
using http protocol
* It uses get and post method with query string
* Demo time

=== Manual testing

* Demo

== Automate manual test cases

=== Derive the test cases

* Test Case 1: Turn on Power supply 1 remotely
* Test Case 2: Verify power supply 1 is on

=== Writing the Test Library
[source, python]
----
include::../library/rps/commands.py[]
----
=== Writing Keywords from the test library

----
*** Keywords ***
RPS send commands
    [Arguments]    ${command}    ${port}    ${state}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}  ${port}  ${state}
    [return]    ${output}

RPS get Power
    [Arguments]    ${command}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}
    [return]    ${output}

----
=== Writing test cases

----
*** Test Cases ***
Turn on Power supply 3 remotely
     ${out}=    RPS send commands     SetPower  2  1
     Should be equal    ${out}  ${True}

Verify power supply 3 is on
    ${out}=     RPS get power    GetPower
    should contain    ${out}  P62=1

Turn off Power supply 3 remotely
     ${out}=    RPS send commands     SetPower  2  0
     Should be equal    ${out}  ${True}

Verify power supply 3 is off
    ${out}=     RPS get power    GetPower
    should contain    ${out}  P62=0
