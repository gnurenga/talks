== Introduction

=== IN 10 mins

* Giving a bird eye view on actuall testing
* Test using Robot
* Understand why it is failed even though log show passed


=== Actuall testing

* Once the user allowed by the gateway
* We want to test actuall traffic is allowed by the gate way.

=== Testing

* Map the user in the gateway
* Send traffic from traffigenerator using wget
* Check the logs traffic allowed in the gate way

== Demo

=== Understand why it is failed even though log show passed

=== Writing Keywords from the test library

----
*** Keywords ***
RPS send commands
    [Arguments]    ${command}    ${port}    ${state}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}  ${port}  ${state}
    [return]    ${output}

RPS get Power
    [Arguments]    ${command}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}
    [return]    ${output}

----
=== Writing test cases

----
*** Test Cases ***
Turn on Power supply 3 remotely
     ${out}=    RPS send commands     SetPower  2  1
     Should be equal    ${out}  ${True}

Verify power supply 3 is on
    ${out}=     RPS get power    GetPower
    should contain    ${out}  P62=1

Turn off Power supply 3 remotely
     ${out}=    RPS send commands     SetPower  2  0
     Should be equal    ${out}  ${True}

Verify power supply 3 is off
    ${out}=     RPS get power    GetPower
    should contain    ${out}  P62=0
