== Introduction

=== IN 10 mins

* Giving a bird eye view on actuall testing
* Test using Robot
* let us Understand why it is failed even though log show passed


=== Actuall testing

* Once the user allowed by the gateway
* We want to test actuall traffic is allowed by the gate way.

=== Testing

* map the user 
* send traffic from traffigenerator using wget
* check the logs traffic allowed in the gate way

== Demo

=== let us Understand why it is failed even though log show passed
* In the TRACE log it is clearly showing wget failed to download
* Then there is no traffic
* If you run it with out TRACE we always think there is no issue

=== Solution
* Alway Check for errors after running any operting sytem command either local
or remote system using ssh from robot
* Irrespective of operating system command after executing in any keyword
always check for errors.
* Errors due to system can be detected and solved easily using return codes
or validating the stderror message.
