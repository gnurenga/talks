# Blind spots when using robot framework

Recently I found that test cases are getting passed, but actually it
is failed based on logs. It is not a problem with robot. It is problem
with the code we are writing and fail to handle errors in a better
way. This is very important in Automation Testing. Especially while
using ssh library.
